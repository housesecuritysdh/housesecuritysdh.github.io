<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>

With many DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Kit, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can prevent any monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
