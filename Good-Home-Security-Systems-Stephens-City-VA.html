<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send smart device signals with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
