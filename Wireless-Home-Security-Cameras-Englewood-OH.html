May move to cellular at some time in the future but staying with dial-up in the meantime.</p>
<p>Another location where Arlo excels is client service.

We 'd most likely suggest a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're starting from scratch.</p>
<p>In truth, federal government action was just recently taken against Vivint due to the fact that the company had concerns with supposed misstatement of offered services and employing unlicensed company representatives.
