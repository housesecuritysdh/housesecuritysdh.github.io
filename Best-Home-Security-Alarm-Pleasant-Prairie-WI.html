<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". If you're trying to find a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense. It ships with 4 smooth and white bullet-style cameras created for indoor and outdoor usage.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
