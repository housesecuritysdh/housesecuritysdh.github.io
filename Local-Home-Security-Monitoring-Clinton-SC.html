<p>SmartThings supports Arlo Pro, Arlo Pro 2, the Pro Base Station, Arlo Q, and Arlo Q Plus. You can trigger a video clip or a SmartThings automation if your camera identifies motion or sound. This sequence of events likewise works in reverse. For example, if someone opens your front door when your SmartThings system is set to away," you can tape-record a clip and sound your Arlo siren (which occurs to be the loudest of the three sirens). Or, if Arlo Pro finds a sound, you can have your lights set to turn on.

<p>Since it's more complicated than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

Instead of the keypad, homeowners control the center through the Scout Alarm mobile app. Through the app, you can view the status and regulate all of your set up devices: sensing units, door panels, and motion detectors.

<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set quantity of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-lasting arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service contract. Paying for the equipment in advance supplies you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as many times as you desire.</p>
