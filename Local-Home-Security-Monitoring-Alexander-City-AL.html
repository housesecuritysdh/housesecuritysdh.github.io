<p>Our alarm systems may be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize a violation.

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

When buying a video recorder, you should first ensure that the device will work with the cameras you have actually acquired.
