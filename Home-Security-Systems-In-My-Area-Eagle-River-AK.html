<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>Ring might not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has gained quite the excitement for many years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring charges. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the free self-monitor" option.</p>
<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we concur with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not think that these issues modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present suggestion.</p>
