For starters, Deep Knowing allows someone to find what they are looking for without having to search through hours of useless video footage.  Think of a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police car in it, we just type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective service for gathering and catching crooks proof.</p>
