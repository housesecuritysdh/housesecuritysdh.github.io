<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to disregard things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly listed below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
