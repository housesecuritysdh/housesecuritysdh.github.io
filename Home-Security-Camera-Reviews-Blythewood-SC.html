<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing duration).
