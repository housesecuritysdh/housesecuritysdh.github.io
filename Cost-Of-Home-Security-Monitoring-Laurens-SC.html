Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they car restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a written not by mail.
