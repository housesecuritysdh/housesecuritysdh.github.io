Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>Video and image feeds have shown important for surveillance - but there's space for more functionality by using audio. Human beings have five senses that jointly allow us to precisely range our environment.

<p>So why don't we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see a lot of growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up.
