<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a destructive aggressor, considering that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly safeguards information by preventing it from being transferred. The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the harmful aggressor to record these codes and use numerous splitting tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based upon the "design" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
