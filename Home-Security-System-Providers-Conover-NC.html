In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal guard. Several cities also need an authorization to even operate a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
