Imagine what someone like that could do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>

<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency situation, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat disappointed by the volume of the alarm.

Your alarm company should be accredited, pay any registration or false alarm fees, and supply physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to warrant cops action.</p>
