<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this article, it will sure make you feel practically vulnerable. The other notable features of the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo model which I'm going to talk about in just a 2nd), it is developed for outdoor along with indoor usage, so it'll work come rain or shine.
