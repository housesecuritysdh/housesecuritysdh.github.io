<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
