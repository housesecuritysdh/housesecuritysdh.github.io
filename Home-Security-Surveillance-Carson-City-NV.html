<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, but after reading this post, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. A couple of minutes into the DIY installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not link. An assistance window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate assisted her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was a concern with the circuit board. Definitely not perfect-- but the representative apologized and shipped her replacement control panel over night.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems generally do not come with upfront costs. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year agreements!

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
