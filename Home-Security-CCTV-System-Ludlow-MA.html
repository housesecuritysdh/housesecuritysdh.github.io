Commercial-grade cameras are developed and developed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Typically, consumer-grade cameras are developed to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being absent or low (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show. Because they have larger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adapt and catch exceptional low light video, commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins.</p>

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
