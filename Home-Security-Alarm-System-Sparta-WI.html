<p>Nest Secure uses loads of clever gadgetry-- a lot so that you might get overwhelmed by all of the options. But hey, Nest is owned by Google, so we 'd expect absolutely nothing less! We really enjoyed using Nest Secure for home protection and automation, but keep in mind that it can get expensive if you don't already have a Nest smart home environment installed. If you're going back to square one, we 'd probably suggest a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint.</p>
<p>In fact, government action was just recently taken against Vivint since the company had issues with supposed misrepresentation of offered services and working with unlicensed company agents. On top of that, some customers experienced difficulties with service cancellation, installation of defective equipment, and extremely pushy reps.</p>
