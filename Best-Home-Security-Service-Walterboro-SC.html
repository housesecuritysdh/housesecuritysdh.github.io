<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
