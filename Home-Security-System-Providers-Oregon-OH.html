<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, frequently use battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have more economical start-up costs, but may fail if the batteries are not preserved. Depending on range and construction products, one or more wireless repeaters might be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be transferred to a new home quickly, an advantage for those who lease or who move regularly. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one between the control panel and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system secures versus a burglar cutting a cable television or from failures of an internet provider.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Incorrect alarms are pricey for the City of Plymouth. Police respond to thousands of false alarms each year.
