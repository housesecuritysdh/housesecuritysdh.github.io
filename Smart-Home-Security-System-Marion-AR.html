These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. If the product to which the device has actually been connected is moved or interrupted, the sensor will activate an alarm.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing opportunity for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-level cops authorities in Washington, DC was caught utilizing cops databases to collect details on customers of a gay club.

In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.
