<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly attempted to give it an appealing edge, and we have to give credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from approximately 4 cameras at a time.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
