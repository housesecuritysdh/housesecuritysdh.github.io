<h2>Home Alarm Systems And Security Services Summerfield</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) installed in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet affordable systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and enjoy it later.
